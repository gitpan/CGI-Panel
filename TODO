Properly document the local_* methods

Make all html producing methods take an 'other_tags' parameter that allows any other
tags (eg style, width etc) to be specified.  May not be needed for event_link and 
the local_* methods

Expand the example to use all the functionality of the module suite.

Include a ready-to-run example (perhaps the same example as in the synopsis)

Consider explicitly writing action => '?' in the start_form call in screen_main in
CGI::Panel::MainPanel so that redundant GET parameters are not shown in the URL window.
